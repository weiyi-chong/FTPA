What are the different types of heart disease?
Heart disease encompasses a wide range of cardiovascular problems. Several diseases and conditions fall under the umbrella of heart disease. Types of heart disease include:

Arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is a heart rhythm abnormality.
Atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a hardening of the arteries.
Cardiomyopathy. This condition causes the heart’s muscles to harden or grow weak.
Congenital heart defects. Congenital heart defects are heart irregularities that are present at birth.
Coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is caused by the buildup of plaque in the heart’s arteries. It’s sometimes called ischemic heart disease.
Heart infections. Heart infections may be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites.
The term cardiovascular disease may be used to refer to heart conditions that specifically affect the blood vessels.
