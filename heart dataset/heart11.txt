Women often experience different signs and symptoms of heart disease than men, specifically with regards to CAD and other cardiovascular diseases.

In fact, a 2003 study looked at the symptoms most often seen in women who’d experienced a heart attack. The top symptoms didn’t include “classic” heart attack symptoms such as chest pain and tingling. Instead, the study reported that women were more likely to say they experienced anxiety, sleep disturbances, and unusual or unexplained fatigue.

What’s more, 80 percent of the women in the study reported experiencing these symptoms for at least one month before their heart attack occurred.

Symptoms of heart disease in women can also be confused with other conditions, such as depression, menopause, and anxiety.

Common heart disease symptoms in women include:

dizziness
paleness
shortness of breath or shallow breathing
lightheadedness
fainting or passing out
anxiety
nausea
vomiting
jaw pain
neck pain
back pain
indigestion or gaslike pain in the chest and stomach
cold sweats
