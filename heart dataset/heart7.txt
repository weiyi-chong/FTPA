Advances are being made every day in the research and treatment of heart disease.

A recent study, to be presented at 2018â€™s annual Radiological Society of North America meeting, has shown that fat distribution across the body increases the risk of heart disease and other cardiometabolic conditions in women.

The 69th Annual Conference of the Cardiological Society of India recently saw the presentation of findings that showed the risk of heart disease increase by 500 percent with baldness and gray hair in men.

Smoking just one cigarette each day can increase the risk of heart disease, according to a new study in the BMJ. The research suggests that cutting out cigarettes completely is the only way to reduce this risk, as opposed to simply cutting down the number of cigarettes.

In other news, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine has linked flu to heart attacks in groups of people who are at risk of heart disease.

A new study also suggests that restless leg syndrome (RLS) may also increase the risk of death from heart-related conditions, especially in older women.
