The symptoms of heart disease depend on which condition is affecting an individual.

However, common symptoms include chest pain, breathlessness, and heart palpitations. The chest pain common to many types of heart disease is known as angina, or angina pectoris, and occurs when a part of the heart does not receive enough oxygen.

Angina can be triggered by stressful events or physical exertion and normally lasts under 10 minutes.

Heart attacks can also occur as a result of different types of heart disease. The signs of a heart attack are similar to angina except that they can occur during rest and tend to be more severe.

The symptoms of a heart attack can sometimes resemble indigestion. Heartburn and a stomach ache can occur, as well as a heavy feeling in the chest.

Other symptoms of a heart attack include:

pain that travels through the body, for example from the chest to the arms, neck, back, abdomen, or jaw
lightheadedness and dizzy sensations
profuse sweating
nausea and vomiting
Heart failure is also an outcome of heart disease, and breathlessness can occur when the heart becomes too weak to circulate blood.

Some heart conditions occur with no symptoms at all, especially in older adults and individuals with diabetes.

The term ‘congenital heart disease‘ covers a range of conditions, but the general symptoms include:

sweating
high levels of fatigue
fast heartbeat and breathing
breathlessness
chest pain
a blue tint to the skin
clubbed fingernails
In severe cases, symptoms can occur from birth. However, these symptoms might not develop until a person is older than 13 years.
